# "Uncovering the Ripple Effects of Covid-19: A Deep Dive into Global Data Using SQL"
### The Covid-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world as we know it. From devastating effects on human health to widespread economic and social implications, the outbreak of Covid-19 in 2019 has left an indelible mark on our global community. But just how far-reaching are these effects, and what insights can we glean from the vast amounts of data collected on the pandemic?
### Enter this project, where I leverage the power of SQL to explore and analyse Covid-19 data obtained from <a href = https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths target= "_blank" >Our World Data</a>. With a data set spanning from February, 2020 to April, 2021,  I utilised Azure Data Studio to analyse and explore the dataset obtained.
### Through my rigorous analysis, I uncovered key trends and patterns in the data that shed light on the true impact of Covid-19. From exploring the rise and fall of infection rates across different regions to analysing the mortality rate due to COVID - 19, globally.
